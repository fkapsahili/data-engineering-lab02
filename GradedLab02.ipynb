    "When setting up BaseX, it quickly becomes apparent that the installation is much more complex and less self-explanatory than that of MongoDB. Since MongoDB is one of the most widely used document stores, it is easy to find relevant resources on the Internet if you have initial difficulties, which is less the case with BaseX. BaseX offers as well as MongoDB an interactive GUI, which is however also less user-friendly than that of MongoDB. MongoDB offers many server-side integrations, including Python with the library pymongo, with a very simple API that makes it very easy to create and manage a MongoDB database and write queries directly in Python, which is not the case with BaseX.\n",
